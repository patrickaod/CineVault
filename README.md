# Project Overview: CineVault 

Your Personalized Movie Collection and Management Application. CineVault is a web-based application designed to allow users to create, manage, and explore their own personalised movie collections. The application provides functionality for user registration, login, adding, editing, and deleting movies. The interface dynamically adjusts to display appropriate UI elements based on the users screen size or to what movies they have in their collection.
The application also supports role-based and session-based access control to ensure secure appropriate access within the platform.
